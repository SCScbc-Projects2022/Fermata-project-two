  The act of writing a letter exemplifies care and consideration for who you're writing to and what it is that you're saying. Named after the musical term meaning, "to take a pause or to suspend," Fermata combines the heart of a letter with the help of technology to create a modern, digital letter. With options to choose a custom font and song to create an ambiance for your recipient, Fermata adds an extra personal touch to the messages you send.

  ## Installation<a name="installation"></a>
  The live application can be accessed using its deployed Heroku link. For developers, after cloning the repository, enter "npm i" in the terminal to install all required dependencies. Then, set up the database in MySQL using the following commands "mysql -h localhost -u root -p", source db/schema.sql", "quit", "npm run seed". Developers can pre-populate the seed files before running npm and test table joins using the database-test.js.

  The initial design for this application included the Spotify library, but the development team was unable to integrate this feature before the deadline. This application is currently powered by YouTube, but is not endorsed by YouTube. This application is for proof of concept only and at the time of initial deployment is only meant for project submission to University of Toronto's School of Continuing Studies Coding BootCamp.</br>

  ### Sharon
  The project direction originally focused on using the Spotify's API and Web Playback SDK. While ideal for security and quality assurance, this ended up being a heavier lift than originally anticipated.</br>

  The development team was able to successfully able to create a Spotify application and impliment OAuth2.0 authorization flow to generate and set an Access Token and a Refresh Token, allowing for continuous calls without authorization expiring.
  
  Due to time restrictions, we decided to impliment a YouTube API workaround.

  As part of our business plan and dedication to improving user experience, Fermata plans to impliment more choices for popular music libraries, Spotify included.
